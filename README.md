#  Housing-App-Setup

We believe in improving the Developer's Experience to foster the development of beautiful apps and softwares. 

Housing App Android/Ios Setup is a tedious process for an Intern, new employee or a senior dev who messed up his/her workspace. The setup process requires a developer to remember and run mulitple commands, stare the screen while these commands run and enjoy the new feeling of becoming a hacker.

Housing App Android Setup consists of 2 parts - 

1. Terminal Part
2. Android Studio Part

Both these parts include critical subparts like - creating .npmrc, local.properties, debug.keystore, google-service.json file. 

To make the Housing App Setup experience, a happier one for new developers we have automated the first part for you with [Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer/)
